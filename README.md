This repository contains the code, visualizations, and explanations for experiments conducted with the MNIST dataset. The focus is on PCA and Lasso regression plus building a neural net from scratch.

The file *pca_lasso_exp* contains an explanation with visualizations of PCA applied to the MNIST dataset. It also includes a theoretical comparison of Lasso and PCA Regression with respect to the mean squared error. 

The jupyter notebook *code_pca_lasso* contains the code for the figures and the simulations used in *pca_lasso_exp*.
